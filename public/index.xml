      <description>To me, the two most impressive websites based on blogdown are:
 Rob J Hyndman&amp;rsquo;s personal website. Live Free or Dichotomize by Lucy and Nick et al.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be more.</description>

      <description>This sample post is mainly for blogdown users. If you do not use blogdown, you can skip the first section.
1. Markdown or R Markdown This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.</description>

      <title>About Hugo XMin</title>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>

      <description>We meet in the laboratory (ETC 211) every Tuesday to tinker around with data and statistics. Our tool of choice is R, software that vastly amplifies your power to explore, visualize, and model data. Reed&amp;rsquo;s RStudio Server is accessible by going to https://rstudio.reed.edu/ and using your college login.
Every week you&amp;rsquo;ll be working with a new data set and organizing your work in an RMarkdown document. You should complete work on your lab by Thursday at 11:59 PM.</description>

      <description>Weekly problem sets to reinforce the concepts from the reading as well as the material that we address in class. You’re encouraged to work on the problem sets with fellow students, though you’ll both need to turn in your own work. Problem sets are due every Monday at the beginning of class.
Problem set guidelines:
Remove all paper fringes and staple all pages Problem set number, date, and name should be clearly stated Write or type out all work and calculations for computational questions and provide clear explanations for yes/no questions Problem sets should be neat and easy to read (i.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Age of Data, where information is all around us, helping us live happier, healthier lives. Or does it? Do we know yet if cell phones cause cancer? Have we come to a decision on whether we should be eating lots of meat or none at all to stay healthy? Despite all of this information, it can be challenging to turn it into the knowledge from which we can make sound decisions.</description>
