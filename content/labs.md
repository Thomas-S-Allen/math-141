We meet in the laboratory (ETC 211) every Tuesday to tinker around with data and statistics. Our tool of choice is R, software that vastly amplifies your power to explore, visualize, and model data. Reed's RStudio Server is accessible by going to https://rstudio.reed.edu/ and using your college login.

Every week you'll be working with a new data set and organizing your work in an RMarkdown document. You should complete work on your lab by Thursday at 11:59 PM.
