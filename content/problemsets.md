title: Problem Sets

---

Weekly problem sets to reinforce the concepts from the reading as well as the material that we address in class. You’re encouraged to work on the problem sets with fellow students, though you’ll both need to turn in your own work. Problem sets are due every **Monday** at the beginning of class.

Problem set guidelines:

Remove all paper fringes and staple all pages
Problem set number, date, and name should be clearly stated
Write or type out all work and calculations for computational questions and provide clear explanations for yes/no questions
Problem sets should be neat and easy to read (i.e. not your scratch work)
Problem sets are practice. A good problem set will not only have the correct answers, it will be presented in a clean and easily understood way.
